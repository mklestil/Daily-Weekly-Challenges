# Welcome to Java_Copy ðŸŽ‰

The goal of this weekly project is to create a programm that can open a file directory an copy the files into a list, with the list you can open the files.
This project grew quickly, it shows me how to document Java code, how to use error handling for the user in JavaFX and the progress bar and progress indicator elements.

## Implementation
JavaFX GUI
Chooser, Binding, Task
AWT Desktop to open files

**Happy Coding!**
